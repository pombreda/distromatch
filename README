 ** README for distromatch

distromatch perform matching of package names across distributions.

It builds an index once for each distribution, then it is able to perform
matching quickly from any distribution to any other one.


 * How to set it up

# Fetch distribution information (updated every 2 days)
wget http://dde.debian.net/exports/distromatch-all.tar.gz

# Unpack it
mkdir data
tar -C data -zxf distromatch-all.tar.gz

# Reindex it (use --verbose if you are curious)
./distromatch --datadir=data --reindex --verbose


 * How to run it:

./distromatch --datadir=data distname pkgname

Given package $pkgname in distribution $distname, shows all the matching
packages in other distributions.

If you only provide $distname, it shows matches for all its packages.
