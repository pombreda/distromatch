To set it up:

 foreach $DIST in debian fedora ...
  1. mkdir dist-$DIST
  2. Create a file dist-$DIST/binsrc containing, on each line:
       binary-package-name source-file-name
     with one line per binary package in the distribution.
  3. Create a file dist-$DIST/files.gz containing, on each line:
       binary-package-name file-pathname
     with one line per file in each package in the distribution.

To run it:

 ./distromatch distname pkgname

 Given package $pkgname in distribution $distname, shows all the matching
 packages in other distributions.

The first time it is run it will spend a lot of time filtering the file lists,
saving the results in dist-*/interesting-files. It will also build the Xapian
indices it needs for lookup.
